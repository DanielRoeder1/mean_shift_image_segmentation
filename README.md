# Image Segementation using Mean Shift

This repository contains code for the Mean Shift image segmentation algorithm including two optimization methods (basin of attraction, search along path)

The user has to determine the window size as well as the parameter for the search along path optimization-
The code allows for inputting any image and previewing its segmented version.
